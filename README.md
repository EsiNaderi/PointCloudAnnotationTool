# PointCloudAnnotationTool
A tool written in C++ to help annotate point clouds. The idea is to have a desktop tool that can help annotate/segment point clouds in order to build a dataset for 3D computer vision problems. 

This is a work under progress right now. If you are still looking to use it, you might want to install PCL on your machine (and cmake of course). Feel free to leave an issue here, if you need help with anything.
